Fangfrisch (German for "freshly caught") is a sibling of the `Clam Anti-Virus`_ freshclam utility.
It allows downloading virus definition files that are not official ClamAV canon, e.g. from Sanesecurity_, URLhaus_ and others.
Fangfrisch was designed with security in mind, to be run by an unprivileged user only.

Detailed documentation_ is available online.
