:subject: Update and verify unofficial Clam Anti-Virus signatures
:xrefstyle: short

Fangfrisch (German for "freshly caught") is a sibling of the https://www.clamav.net[Clam Anti-Virus] freshclam utility.
It allows downloading virus definition files that are not official ClamAV canon, e.g. from https://sanesecurity.com[Sanesecurity] and https://urlhaus.abuse.ch[URLhaus].
Fangfrisch was designed with security in mind, to be run by an unprivileged user only.
For those curious about the development history, a https://github.com/rseichter/fangfrisch/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst[changelog] is available online.

== Update strategy

Fangfrisch is expected to run periodically, e.g. using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron].
Fangfrisch will attempt to download digests first (if available upstream), and only retrieve corresponding signature files when their recorded digest changes, minimising transfer volumes.

I recommend running Fangfrisch at 10 minute intervals.
There is no need to worry about overburdening your machine, the network or remote signature providers.
Each individual download is recorded in the database, and whenever Fangfrisch is run, it checks those recorded timestamps against the preconfigured provider intervals.
No network connections are made for downloaded signature files which are considered "too young to update".

Imagine a provider interval setting of 45 minutes.
Even if launched every 10 minutes, Fangfrisch will not attempt to download related signature files before 45 minutes have passed since the last recorded successful download.
Provider intervals are set to reasonable defaults internally, but you can override them if necessary.

== Installation

Fangfrisch requires Python version 3.9 or newer.
While Fangfrisch was initially written for Python 3.7, security support (the final lifecycle stage) for that version was terminated by the Python Software Foundation in 2023. Python 3.8 reached its EOL in 2024.

The recommended installation method is using the https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/[pip command] in a virtual Python environment.
Here is an example listing of commands for BASH, to be executed as root, assuming that you will be running Fangfrisch as an unprivileged user who is member of the *clamav* group:

=== Create home directory

----
mkdir -m 0770 -p /var/lib/fangfrisch
chgrp clamav /var/lib/fangfrisch
----

This will grant group members the necessary write access to create the database (see <<dbsetup>>).

=== Prepare and activate venv

----
cd /var/lib/fangfrisch
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
----

=== Install via https://pypi.org/project/fangfrisch/[PyPI]

----
pip install fangfrisch
----

This step will also create an executable launcher script `venv/bin/fangfrisch`.

== Installation packages

As an alternative to pip-based installation, there are packages available for the following Linux distributions:

* Arch Linux: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-fangfrisch/[packages/python-fangfrisch].
Support contact: Arch package maintainer.

* Clear Linux: https://github.com/clearlinux-pkgs/fangfrisch[clearlinux-pkgs/fangfrisch].
Support contact: Clear Linux package maintainers.

* Debian Linux: https://packages.debian.org/sid/fangfrisch[fangfrisch (utils)].
Support contact: Debian package maintainers.

* Gentoo Linux: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-antivirus/fangfrisch[app-antivirus/fangfrisch].
Support contact: Gentoo package maintainers.

* NixOS: https://search.nixos.org/packages?type=packages&query=fangfrisch[fangfrisch]
Support contact: NixOS package maintainers.

== Configuration

A configuration file is mandatory, uses an INI-File-like structure and must contain a `db_url` entry.
All other settings are optional.
However, unless you enable one signature file provider section, Fangfrisch naturally won't do much.

Use the `--conf` command line argument (see <<usage>>) to specify the path to your configuration file.
Note that there is no default location.

----
# Minimal example configuration, meant for testing.

[DEFAULT]
db_url = sqlite:////var/lib/fangfrisch/db.sqlite
local_directory = /var/lib/clamav

[urlhaus]
enabled = yes
----

* *cleanup*: Cleanup method used for provider sections.
Default: `automatic`, alternative: `disabled`.
In automatic mode, Fangfrisch will attempt to delete obsolete virus definition files whenever you disable a provider section.
Should you disable this option, orphaned files will be left behind, and you need to ensure cleanup by different means.
* *connection_timeout*: Timeout in seconds, used when establishing network connections to download signature files.
Default: `30`.
Be aware that longer timeouts increase the risk of multiple Fangfrisch instances running concurrently.
This could, in turn, cause database access problems, and network socket congestion.
If your Internet connection is fast, I even suggest testing timeout values lower than the default 30 seconds.
* *db_url*: Database URL in https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#supported-databases[SQLAlchemy syntax].
Mandatory, no default.
Typically, a local https://www.sqlite.org[SQLite] database will suffice.
* *enabled*: Scan this section for URLs?
Default: `false`.
* *integrity_check*: Mechanism for integrity checks.
Default: `sha256`.
You can use `disabled` if the signature file provider offers no checksums.
* *interval*: Interval between downloads.
Defaults are provider-dependent.
Values can be expressed in human-readable form (e.g. `12h` or `45m`).
Please respect the limits set by each provider.
* *local_directory*: Downloaded files are stored here.
No default, so the current working directory of the Python process is used.
As this can vary depending on how you launch Fangfrisch, it is highly recommended to define an absolute path like `/var/lib/clamav` instead.
You can override this option in provider sections to separate downloads based on origin.
* *log_format*: See https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter[Formatter class] documentation for details.
Fangfrisch uses sensible defaults depending on the selected log method.
* *log_level*: Choose one of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING` (default), `ERROR` or `FATAL`.
* *log_method*: Either `console` (default, meaning stdout/stderr) or `syslog`.
For the latter, you can also specify a *log_target*.
* *log_target*: The https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424[syslog] target address.
Typical values are `/dev/log` (local Linux domain socket), `localhost` or `host.domain.tld:udpport`.
If no target is specified, `localhost` is assumed.
The UDP port number defaults to 514.
* *max_size*: Maximum expected file size.
The default is `10MB`, but all predefined providers have individual size limits (see <<internalconf>>).
Values are can be expressed in human-readable form (e.g. `250KB` or `3MB`).
Fangfrisch attempts to inspect the content length before downloading virus signature files so as not to download files larger than the defined limit.
If providers don't respond with content length information, Fangfrisch will log a warning but download the data anyway.
* *on_update_exec*: If any files were downloaded during a pass, a command can be executed in after the pass finishes.
No default.
A typical value is `clamdscan --reload`.
Starting with Fangfrisch 1.9.0, this option may be overridden in individual sections, permitting per-provider actions.
* *on_update_timeout*: Timeout for the `on_update_exec` command, in seconds.
Default: 30.
This option may also be overridden in individual sections.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html[See here] for details about the configuration parser and extended interpolation.
<<Semantics>> provides additional information on how configuration options are interpreted.

=== Default providers

Fangfrisch contains internal defaults for the following providers, listed in alphabetical order:

* http://sigs.interserver.net/[InterServer]
* https://www.malwarepatrol.net[Malwarepatrol]
* https://sanesecurity.com[Sanesecurity]
* https://www.securiteinfo.com/services/anti-spam-anti-virus/improve-detection-rate-of-zero-day-malwares-for-clamav.shtml[SecuriteInfo]
* https://urlhaus.abuse.ch[URLhaus]

I have also included "Fangfrisch News" (see <<ffnews>>).
Providers can be enabled by specifiying `enabled = yes` in the desired configuration file sections.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to examine the respective settings for yourself before enabling providers.

The defaults may not suit your personal preferences, and some providers require additional configuration, e.g. an access token.

----
include::example.conf[]
----

=== User-defined providers

Fangfrisch is of course not limited to the internal defaults.
You can define as many additional virus definition providers as you like.
The following defines a fictional provider:

----
[fictionalprovider]
enabled = yes
integrity_check = md5
interval = 90m
prefix = http://fictional-provider.tld/clamav-unofficial/

# Reference the defined prefix in URL definitions. Values in
# other sections can be referenced using ${section:option}.
url_eggs = ${prefix}eggs.ndb
url_spam = ${prefix}spam.hdb

# Override local file name for url_spam
filename_spam = spam_spam_spam_lovely_spam.db

# Execute command after each fresh download from url_eggs
on_update_eggs = echo Fresh eggs in {path}
----

=== Semantics

Fangfrisch will scan enabled sections for lines prefixed with `url_` to determine download sources for virus definition files.

* The value of `integrity_check` determines both the expected filename suffix for digests and the hashing mechanism used for verification.
* Local file names will be determined by parsing URLs, but can be manually overridden.
To change the file name for `url_xyz`, set `filename_xyz` to the desired value.
* To launch a command after data was downloaded for `url_xyz`, define `on_update_xyz`.
The command string may contain a `{path}` placeholder, which will be substituted with the full path of the downloaded file.

You can disable refresh operations for selected URLs by assigning either an empty value or setting it to `url_xyz = disabled`.
Note that disabling URLs in this manner does _not_ delete any previously downloaded files.

=== Proxy support

Fangfrisch relies on the _requests_ library to download files, which supports environment variables like `HTTPS_PROXY`.
Please refer to https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies[section Advanced Usage, subsection Proxies] in the _requests_ online documentation for details.

[[dbsetup]]
== Preparing the database

After completing the configuration, make sure to create the database structure by running the `initdb` command in a root shell as shown below.
Running `--force initdb` will drop existing database tables.
For SQLite, deleting the database file is a viable alternative.

----
sudo -u clamav -- fangfrisch --conf /etc/fangfrisch.conf initdb
----

IMPORTANT: Fangfrisch need never be run as root.
Choose an unprivileged user instead (typically *clamav*).

[[usage]]
== Usage

Command line arguments are as follows:

[%unbreakable]
----
include::usage.txt[]
----

You can choose among following actions:

* *dumpconf*: Dump the effective configuration to stdout, combining both internal defaults and your own settings.
The effective configuration for the example shown in <<Configuration>> is available in <<sampleeff>>.

* *dumpmappings*: Dump URL-to-filepath mappings, as recorded in the database refresh log, to stdout.
See <<dbstructure>> for details.

* *initdb*: Create the database structure.
This needs to be run only once, before the first refresh.
Using the `--force` option will drop existing tables from the database.

* *refresh*: Refresh the configured URLs.
The `--force` option can be used to override download interval settings.

As stated before, Fangfrisch is typically run using cron.
Depending on your host OS, you may use a systemd timer as an alternative.
An example crontab looks like this:

----
HOME=/var/lib/fangfrisch
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week user command
*/10 * * * * clamav sleep $((RANDOM \% 42)); venv/bin/fangfrisch --conf /etc/fangfrisch.conf refresh
----

== Support

The project is hosted on https://github.com/rseichter/fangfrisch[GitHub].
Before opening tickets or contacting the author, _always_ check https://github.com/rseichter/fangfrisch/issues[existing issues] first, including closed ones.
This is not meant to discourage you; it just saves time and effort for all involved.
Please contact the author mailto:{email}[{author}] only after having done your own research.
Thank you.

=== Reporting possible problems

If you experience problems, please start by trying to figure out underlying issues on your own.
Running with DEBUG level logging helps with that.
Should your efforts fail, consider filing a GitHub issue.
Each issue needs to answer the questions listed below.

If you answer question number 1, 2 or 3 with "no", do not file an issue.
Please answer all other questions as detailed as you can, within reason.

1. Have you checked the documentation?
2. Have you checked all existing issues, including closed ones?
3. Have you done your personal best to resolve the issue on your own?
4. What exactly did you do?
5. What did you expect to happen?
6. What happened instead?
7. What was your exact setup (operating system, Python core version, Python module versions)?

=== Offering suggestions

The list of questions is shorter, but important nonetheless:

1. Have you checked the documentation?
2. Have you checked all existing issues, including closed ones?
3. Do you consider the suggested feature helpful for more people than just yourself?

If you answered "yes" for all questions, please explain your idea in a sufficiently thorough manner.
Use examples, graphics, and whatever else you think would help others to understand your suggestion.

=== Discussion precedes contribution

I do not accept any code or documentation contributions which have not been previously agreed upon.
This means the order of steps is as follows:

1. Open an issue or discussion topic first.
2. Have a conversation about the matter at hand.
3. Reach a consensus about both form and content of the contribution.
4. Wait for a yay/nay signal from me.

Please do _not_ submit any pull requests before I ask for them, as they will be closed.
This outlined, proven practice will save time for all involved.
See Heather McNamee's blog https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/[Always start with an issue] for more information.

[[internalconf]]
[appendix]
== Default configuration

Fangfrisch contains the following internal configuration settings as defaults.
As a safety measure, all sections are disabled by default.
Entries with the `!url_` prefix are included for reference only.
These represent data sources which are not recommended for general use.
Possible reasons: Some sources have an elevated risk of false positives, are not free to use, or contain legacy data.
Enabling a section will not enable these specially prefixed entries.

----
include::internal.conf[]
----

[[sampleeff]]
[appendix]
== Effective configuration

The following effective configuration is the result of combining internal defaults (see <<internalconf>>) with the example settings shown in <<Configuration>>.

----
include::combined.conf[]
----

[[ffnews]]
[appendix]
== Fangfrisch News

This pseudo provider does not offer antivirus signature files.
It is only meant for me to pass news about Fangfrisch to you, the user, in lieu of a mailing list.
Don't expect this to happen on a regular basis.
I am only thinking about release notifications at this point in time.
Still, I kindly ask you to please enable this service by adding the following to your configuration file:
----
[fangfrischnews]
enabled = yes
# Uncomment/adapt the following to trigger a script in case of news.
# script = /path/to/script/fangfrisch-has-news.sh
----
This will only enable Fangfrisch to occasionally download small text files, nothing more.
You will not need to read the content, nor will anything else happen, unless you modify the `script` option.
Here is an example script which you could use to have downloaded news items mailed to you.
It needs to be readable for the user account running Fangfrisch, and the sender/recipient addresses obviously have to be adapted.
For your convenience, the latest version of the script can be https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rseichter/fangfrisch/master/contrib/fangfrisch-has-news.sh[downloaded here].
----
include::../contrib/fangfrisch-has-news.sh[]
----

[[dbstructure]]
[appendix]
== Database structure

While users can technically access the Fangfrisch backend database directly, its structure and content are considered *private*.
They may change at any time, without notice.

=== Accessing mappings

In contrast to direct database access, the *dumpmappings* action allows accessing selected parts of database entries in a stable manner.
Specifically, it returns 3-tuples (provider name, URL, local file path).
Elements are separated by horizontal tabulators to facilitate piping the output into `awk` or similar utilities.
If specified, the `provider` option is interpreted as a regular expression, and only DB records with matching provider column are returned.
That means if you have providers _foo_ and _foobar_, you need to use anchoring (e.g. `^foo$`) if you only wish to match entries for the former provider.
Make sure to use quoting as required by your shell.
Example usage:

----
# Print all recorded mappings for the [example] provider section.
fangfrisch --conf /etc/fangfrisch.conf --provider '^example$' dumpmappings
----

----
# Delete all files that were downloaded by Fangfrisch.
# DON'T EXECUTE THIS UNLESS YOU REALLY MEAN IT!
fangfrisch --conf /etc/fangfrisch.conf dumpmappings | awk '{print $3}' | xargs /bin/rm
----
